    "In this version a software will recognize certain mouse gestures on a PC, but you need to somehow send that information to the SIXT33N. To do this, we will use an audio link that varies the time between two pulses to encode the command. In EE16A, when you hacked a light switch, you used On-Off Keying (OOK) to send a signal. Now you will use a similar system, but on an audible range instead. You will need a microphone circuit that processes the mic signal into something you can record using the Launchpad ADC. This processing includes applying some gain and filtering higher frequencies to avoid aliasing. The sampled signal then passes through a digital bandpass filter and a low pass filter to recover the sent information (much like demodulating and low-pass-filtering in an AM receiver).\n",

For example a sinusoid for 0.1s continued with nothing for 0.1s and then another sinusoid for 0.1s encodes a certain command.
