    "In this phase we will first build the SIXT33N chassis and the sensors (wheel encoders) and actuators (motor drivers). We will also power the car up using a 9V battery. Next, we will model the the car as an open loop system. We will gather some dynamics data to figure out the variables in our model and lastly build a closed loop controller. By the end of the phase, you should be able to control the trajectory of the car, which will be integrated with the other components of the project in the last phase.\n",

    "## Motor Drivers\n",
    "To be able to move, the car needs motor drivers. The DC motors we use are usually driven by a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal which will be produced by the Launchpad. A PWM signal is simply a square wave at a certain frequency but with variable duty cycle (percentage time the signal is high in a period). However, the wheels need a higher voltage and current source than the Launchpad can supply. To solve this issue, we will hook the wheels up to 5V and use a PMOS transistor control whether the motor is powered or not. Recall that a PMOS conducts when the gate-source voltage is higher than a threshold. In the circuit below, the terminal connected to the 5V power source is the source terminal. That means when the Launchpad outputs a 0 the motor is driven, and when it outputs a 1 the motor is off. Keep this in mind - it will be handy later.\n",

Note that the two PMOSes for each driver are connected in parallel. The breadboard should go on the car chassis. The pin diagram of the PMOS is reproduced below. Be careful when you connect the PMOS and double check which terminal is which since it is easy to damage if you hooked it up incorrectly. Note that the diagram says top view. Also note that the diagram below is not in the same orientation as the one in the circuit above. The motor is reversible so connect it any way for now. If it turns out to go backwards later, just reverse the two terminals of the motor. Leave the gate of the PMOS connected to 5V for now - we will connect it to the Launchpad later.\n",

    "\n",
    "Besides driving, the car also needs to be able to sense how far it has travelled and the speed at which it is travelling. To do this, we will use a <a href=\"http://www.sharp-world.com/products/device/lineup/data/pdf/datasheet/gp1a58hr_e.pdf\">photointerrupter</a> and a wheel encoder. When you built the car you should have attached a disk with holes to the motors. You should also have soldered wires to the photointerrupters. We will now connect these in the correct way. The diagram below shows the photointerrupter from the top (i.e. black plastic facing you, pins going into the screen).\n",

The left side of the component is a photodiode which conducts current only when it sees the light from the infrared LED, just like the solar cells you used last semester. There is some circuitry to make the signal a digital signal so the output is a square wave. If the space between the LED and the photodiode is empty, it will output a high signal. If the space is blocked and the light is obscured it outputs a low signal. From this, we can imply how fast the wheel is moving from the holes in the encoder, because the square wave will be at higher frequencies for high speeds and low frequencies for low speeds.\n",

    "Rather than trying to run after your car while carrying a power soure, we will use a 9V battery as the input to your voltage regulator. However, to make it easier and safer to turn the battery on and off, we will add a switch. Use the middle pin of the switch and one of the other pins to connect the 9V battery lead to the voltage regulator input. The ground of the 9V battery lead should go to the ground of the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you are testing things at the bench, use the benchtop power supply. The battery does not contain a lot of energy and the motors take a lot of power. If you leave it running it will only last a little over an hour. If the voltage of the battery drops below 7V, ask for a new one from your GSI. <b>Do not connect both the power source and the battery at the same time. Don't do it.</b>\n",

The sampling period is $T_s = 200$ms. Power the Launchpad from the voltage regulator using the 5V pin. Place the car in a large empty space and hit the reset button. After a couple seconds it will start moving and a couple seconds after that it starts collecting data. When it stops moving bring the car to your PC and connect the Launchpad to your PC using a USB cable. Open Serial Monitor in Energia - you will see a lot of data printed.
