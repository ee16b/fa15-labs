    "In this phase we will first build the SIXT33N chassis and the sensors (wheel encoders) and actuators (motor drivers). We will also power the car up using a 9V battery. Next, we will model the the car as an open loop system. We will gather some dynamics data to figure out the variables in our model and lastly build a closed loop controller. By the end of the phase, you should be able to move straight at a constant speed. In the last phase, you will integrate your moving car with all the other components of your project.\n",

    "## Motor Drivers\n",
    "To be able to move, the car needs motor drivers. The DC motors we use are usually driven by a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal which will be produced by the Launchpad. A PWM signal is simply a square wave at a certain frequency but with variable duty cycle (percentage time the signal is high in a period). However, the wheels need a higher voltage and current source than the Launchpad can supply. To solve this issue, we will hook the wheels up to 5V and use a PMOS transistor control whether the motor is powered or not. Recall that a PMOS conducts when the gate-source voltage is higher than a threshold. In the circuit below, the terminal connected to the 5V power source is the source terminal. That means when the Launchpad outputs a 0 the motor is driven, and when it outputs a 1 the motor is off. Keep this in mind - it will be handy later.\n",

    "Besides driving, the car also needs to be able to sense how far it has travelled and the speed at which it is travelling. To do this, we will use a <a href=\"http://www.sharp-world.com/products/device/lineup/data/pdf/datasheet/gp1a58hr_e.pdf\">photointerrupter</a> and a wheel encoder. When you built the car you should have attached a disk with holes to the motors. You should also have soldered wires to the photointerrupters. We will now connect these in the correct way.

There is some circuitry to make the signal a digital signal so the output is a square wave. If the space between the LED and the photodiode is empty, it will output a high signal. If the space is blocked and the light is obscured it outputs a low signal. From this, we can imply how fast the wheel is moving from the holes in the encoder, because the square wave will be at higher frequencies for high speeds and low frequencies for low speeds.\n",

    "Rather than trying to run after your car while carrying a power soure, we will use a 9V battery as the input to your voltage regulator. However, to make it easier and safer to turn the battery on and off, we will add a switch. Use the middle pin of the switch and one of the other pins to connect the 9V battery lead to the voltage regulator input. The ground of the 9V battery lead should go to the ground of the circuit.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will power the Launchpad through its 5V pin. However, because the motors are going to draw a lot of power, they make the power rail too noisy for the Launchpad. To fix this you will want to make a slightly quieter power rail for the launchpad. Connect the 5V output of the voltage regulator to the 5V rail, and also connect it to a separate row in the breadboard. In that new 5V row, add a large (>10$\\mu$F) capacitor from that row to ground. Use this 5V row to power up the Launchpad's 5V pin. The capacitor will keep the 5V supply from dropping out when the motors turn on and will ensure a stable power source for the Launchpad."

    "Once you are satisfied that your motors work and your closed loop is implemented, put the car on the ground. Click the reset button, the SIXT33N should go in a straight line. Does it behave how you expect? If it behaves erroneously (for example the controller oscillates), go back to the simulation and try different eigenvalues. This is an artifact of using a linear model as an approximation of the system and can be solved by picking a more suitable controller gain. Most of the time using a smaller gain helps stabilize the system - the tradeoff is the system reaches steady state slower."
