    "Welcome to the first lab of EE16B! This is the first of a series of 2 labs in the BMI module in which you will deconstruct and analyze brain signals. In this lab we will be using a simulated time domain signal of a subject whose brain waves were recorded while moving a cursor around on a computer screen, much like the video in Prof. Jose Carmena's guest lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='overview'></a>\n",
    "### Lab Overview\n",
    "The ability to convert from the time domain to the frequency domain is a crucial skill in signal processing because while some data might not look particularly useful in the time domain, seeing it in the frequency domain may shed some insight. The analysis of brain waves is a real world application of this domain conversion; researchers have been able to tie brain activity to the actual movement of a primate using complciated analysis in the freqeuncy domain. In this lab we will do some simple analysis of our own to predict some basic actions performed by a subject through looking at its brain signals in frequency domain."
